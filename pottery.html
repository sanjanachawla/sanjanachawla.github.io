							<h1>Simulating Pottery</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pottery_cover2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In the winter semester of 2021, I took a class called Elec 341
								which taught us about control systems. In this class, we learnt 
								how to simulate and control complex electo-mechanical circuits and 
								about how to evaluate them as feedback functions. One day, when I 
								was doing pottery at home, I thought I could apply the exact same principals. 
							</p>
							<p> So I took it to Matlab! I seeked to answer one question: 
								Could I try to model the same thing that I see 
								while doing pottery by hand, with transfer functions that we used in 
								this class?
							</p>
							<p> I stated out with just trying to model the rim. Image starting with a perfect circle, 
								now I want to stretch this circle with my hands to make it bigger. I do that by pulling on 
								either side of the circle, until it becomes an ellipse. Then, I quickly add force in the opposite 
								direction as the wheel rotates to smoothen out this ellipse to a new, bigger, circle. 
								With the help of Matlab, I applied that same principal to all other parts of the 3D figure, 
								and made Matlab simulate it with 3D plots and animations
