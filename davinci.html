							<h1>Working With the DaVinci </h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/davinci.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>If you are familiar with the world of surgical robotics, you know the famous DaVinci
                                Robot. For my second capstone at UBC, a team of 3 others and I were lucky enough to get to be 
                                partnered with a an R&D lab at UBC that is works with the surgical robot. 
                            </p>
							<p>This is a teleoperated robot that assists surgeons while performing minimally invasive surgery.
                                The surgeons interact with the robot through a console where they can control its movements, and 
                                the view the surgical workspace through a camera  feed. 
                            </p>
							<p>But robot-assisted-tele-operated-surgery still has its drawbacks. The surgeons use both their arms
                                to control the robot's arms, but when they want to switch the viewpoint of their workspace, they gave to 
                                use the clutch to then connect to the camera joints to be able to control its position instead of the robot's.
                                As you can imagine, this involves a lot of back and forth, and stopping the current task they they are working
                                on to switch their viewpoint. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Our job, as the team of Capstone students, is to automate the camera movements of the robot so that it follows
                                the surgical task taking place. This would reduce the cognitive load applied on the surgeons, and hopefully help them
                                perform surgeries faster, and with a bit more ease. The best analogy would be them switching from driving a stick operated car
                                to an automatic. 
                            </p>
                            <h2>Into the techincal side ... </h2>
                            <p> We decided to take an optimization approach to this problem. By building on previous work done by the lab 
                                We took a set of 8 movement goals or rules that the camera should follow while the robot is operating. We 
                                assign weights to how much we value that particular rule, and the algorithm works with minimizing the pssoble losses. </p>
                                <p> All of the coding for this project was done in Python, and we used CoppeliaSim to simulate our results, and 
                                    after verifing our results in sim, we moved on to trying it out on the real robot too.
                                </p>
